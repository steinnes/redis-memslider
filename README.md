## rslide

`rslide` is a tool to gradually lower the [Redis](https://redis.io)
maxmemory directive.

Redis is single threaded and lowering the maximum memory below the used
level will cause the database to enter a blocking eviction loop until the
database fits within the new maxmemory value.

This is useful when for ex.  when reducing the amount of volatile data in
a redis database with a mixed keyspace (ie. not all data is volatile)
before slaving or migrating the data somewhere else.

## Setup

### from PyPI

    $ pip install redis-memslider
    $ rslide ...

### from source

    $ git clone git@github.com:steinnes/redis-memslider.git
    $ cd redis-memslider
    $ make
    $ rslide ...


## Example usage/output:

    $ rslide -r 1073741824 -s 20 -i 1

Note how `rslide` actually performs 21 steps, but the second-to-last value
is 4 bytes above the target of 3221225472.  This is because `rslide` will
continue until the new maxmemory setting is below or equal to the target.
