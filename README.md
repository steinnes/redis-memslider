redis-memslider
---------------

`rslide` is a tool to gradually lower redis maxmemory settings.  This is useful when for ex.
when reducing the amount of volatile data in a redis database with a mixed keyspace (ie. not
all data is volatile) before slaving or migrating the data somewhere else.

When you call `config set maxmemory ...` in redis and the new value is lower than the currently
used value, the process will block while executing key eviction policies (as defined by your
`maxmemory-policy`) until the used memory is less than the new `maxmemory` value.

If you are working with a large dataset in production and need to migrate it elsewhere, then
being able to shrink the maxmemory value without blocking all work for several seconds (in
our case lowering the value by `256 MB` or `268435456` bytes on an m2.2xlarge machine with a
redis dataset of 45GB in memory, took around 3-5 seconds.

`rslide` is intended as a tool which allows you to lower the maxmemory much more gradually,
causing less harm to production systems.

Example usage/output:
---------------------
    $ rslide -r 1073741824 -s 20 -i 1

Note how `rslide` actually performs 21 steps, but the second-to-last value is 4 bytes above the
target of 3221225472.  This is because `rslide` will continue until the new maxmemory setting is
below or equal to the target.
